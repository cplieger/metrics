// The shared machinery for this package's allocation contracts, which live in
// counter_test.go, gauge_test.go, histogram_test.go, metrics_test.go and
// exposition_test.go — each beside the source file whose cost it pins.
//
// The library's cost model has two halves and both are now measured: recording
// into an EXISTING series allocates nothing, and creating a new series costs a
// bounded constant. The weekly benchmark tracker cannot stand in for either.
// It alerts on the ratio between consecutive runs, so it catches a 0 -> n
// regression (an infinite ratio, at any threshold) but is structurally blind
// to a bounded count drifting: 260 -> 380 allocations per scrape is a ratio of
// 1.46, and 2 -> 3 is exactly 1.5. The bounded counts are therefore where
// these contracts earn their keep, and the exposition ones bound a per-metric
// RATE rather than a total, because a scrape's total cost is legitimately
// proportional to how many metrics the registry holds.
//
// Three rules every contract here follows, each of which is a way to measure
// the wrong thing:
//
//   - Fixtures are built OUTSIDE the measured closure. Registering a metric,
//     constructing a registry and building a label-value slice all allocate,
//     and inside the closure that cost is reported as the library's.
//   - The closure is deliberate about which path it takes. A registry is
//     stateful and [testing.AllocsPerRun] runs the closure runs+1 times, so a
//     closure touching ONE label set measures the loaded fast path on every
//     run after the first, while one touching a FRESH label set per run
//     measures series creation. Each contract's comment says which it is.
//   - No t.Parallel. AllocsPerRun reads process-wide malloc counters and
//     panics outright when called from a parallel test.

// allocRuns is the AllocsPerRun run count for the record-path contracts.
// AllocsPerRun divides as integers, so the average of a path that allocates
// nothing is exactly 0 and one stray allocation per hundred runs still floors
// to 0; the count is high enough that a per-call allocation cannot hide and
// low enough that the contracts stay instant under -race.
const allocRuns = 100

// scrapeAllocRuns is the run count for the exposition sweeps. It is lower
// because one run of the largest fixture performs thousands of allocations, so
// the average is already stable at this count, and because a sweep pays it once
// per registry size at every shape it measures.

// allocCeiling returns the allocation bound for the mode this binary was built

// instrumentation defeats some of the compiler's escape analysis, so the
// exposition path measures about a third more allocations per metric under
// -race (7.0 plain against 9.4 per counter family, measured) while the record
// paths stay at exactly 0 in both modes. CI runs the suite with -race, so a
// contract carrying only the plain number would have to be loosened until it
// passed there, which is the same as not gating the plain number; and skipping
// it under -race would leave the contract gating nothing where CI runs it.
