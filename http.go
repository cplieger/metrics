package metrics

import "time"

// RecordHTTP records one HTTP request into the caller-supplied counter and
// histogram. The caller owns the label set (arity, ordering, and any path
// templating); labelVals must match c's label names. h receives d.Seconds().
// Either metric may be nil to skip it.
//
// Label values must come from a bounded set: each distinct combination
// allocates a series retained until Delete/Reset, so raw paths or header
// values allow unbounded memory growth.
//
// This is the metrics-side hook only: it takes no request and no status, so
// middleware captures both and calls RecordHTTP once the response is complete.
// Its parameters are this package's own types, so middleware that does not
// import metrics cannot take RecordHTTP as its hook; the wiring is a small
// adapter that spreads the middleware's per-request values onto labelVals.
//
// With webhttp, adapt the access-log hook WithRecordRouteMetric registers: its
// (method, path) pair is bounded by the route table rather than by traffic,
// which is what the rule above asks for, and the access logger records the
// status itself. A zero-dependency module cannot ship a compiling example of
// that pairing, so the hook's signature and label derivation live in webhttp's
// own godoc for WithRecordRouteMetric and RequestMetric.

	if c != nil {
		c.Inc(labelVals...)
