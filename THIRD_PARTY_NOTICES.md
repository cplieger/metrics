# Third-party notices

This library has no dependencies and contains no third-party code.

Two designs are followed from [prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) (Apache-2.0) without any of its code being included; each is named at the lines of ours that follow it:

- **A construction error is captured into the metric value instead of panicking**, the `Desc.err` shape in client_golang's `prometheus/desc.go`. Ours is the `err` field on each of the six metric types (`counter.go:38`, `counter.go:132`, `gauge.go:11`, `gauge.go:84`, `histogram.go:97`, `histogram.go:184`), the same field on the registry for an invalid prefix (`metrics.go:103`), and the constructor-side check that returns the error to capture (`validate.go:121`). Recording then diverges: a metric carrying an error records nothing here, while client_golang keeps recording and reports the error at scrape time.
- **`MustRegister` panics on the first registration error**, the shape of `(*Registry).MustRegister` in client_golang's `prometheus/registry.go`. Ours is `metrics.go:227`.
